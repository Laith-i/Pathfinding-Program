# Pathfinding Program

This project implements various pathfinding algorithms using `osmnx` and `networkx` libraries, designed to calculate optimal routes on a real-world road network.

## Features

- Implements popular pathfinding algorithms:
  - A* Algorithm
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  - Bidirectional A*
  - A* with Landmarks
  - A* Backtracking with constraints
- Visualizes paths and compares performance metrics of algorithms.
- Configurable constraints for road safety, congestion, and restricted areas.
